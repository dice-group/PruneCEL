/**
 * This class is a visitor that returns {@code true} if the given class
 * expression should not be put into a {@code FILTER NOT EXISTS} (FNE) statement
 * since the statement itself will consist of one (or several) FNE statements.
 * Instead, such an expression should be simply negated.
 * 
 * For example, trying to add an FNE statement with the expression ∀r.⊥ leads to
 * an FNE statement within an FNE, without any additional triple pattern in the
 * outer filter. That means that the variables within the filter and outside of
 * the filter are not connected, anymore. Hence, it is easier to add ∃r.⊤
 * instead. The same holds for negated, named classes (¬A) or a conjunction of
 * these two types of statements.
 * 
 * Note that the given statement should already have been preprocessed for being
 * transformed into a SPARQL query.
